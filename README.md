# Python Simulation Module for UCSD BENG125

Written for **Spring 2025** quarter session with Professor Jeff Hasty. 

## Network Description

The module was written to model the simplified dynamics of p53 autoregulation and ubiquitation by MDM2. The equation and parameters are explictly defined in `set_params_eqns.py` and changes to those statements should be reflected throughout the entire module. 

***NOTE***: The model was not fit to experimental data and is limited in many aspects ; some assumptions may not be biologically sound. The goal was to replicate the qualitative behaviors seen in literature to practice *dynamics* not biology. There is *no* physiological relevance or innovative features.

Although there is module functionality, each Python file has a main function for direct script calls that generate the figures that were included in our report. These may be useful as example cases for future use.

## Features By File

### 1D Functionality

- `solve_1D.py`
- `diffeq_1D.py`
- `bifurcations_1D.py`
- `param_sweep_1D.py`

### 2D Functionality

- `diffeq_2D.py`
- `phase_plane_2D.py`

No type annotations and my naming conventions get shaky throughout the module - sorry.

## Requirements

The scripts were developed in an environment with the follwing packages and their appropriate dependancies. For full intended functionality, have the following installed or equivalent versions. 

Most up-to-date, stable versions of these packages should work fine.

0. python 3.12.6
1. scipy 1.15.2
2. numpy 2.2.5
3. matplotlib 3.9.2
4. tqdm 6.4.1 - only used for parameter sweeping scripts that run for > 1 min.
